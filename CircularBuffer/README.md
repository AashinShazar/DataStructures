# CircularBuffer Assignment
## Project: Working with a linked node queue implementation of a circular buffer

## Project Overview
In this assignment you will implement a simulation of a printer buffer that accepts printing jobs. The printer has limited buffer size of maximum 10 jobs. If the printer received any job while its buffer is full, it will reject the job. Printing a job will remove it from the queue. The priority is FIFO, i.e. based on arrival time, first job added to the buffer is the first job to be removed.
