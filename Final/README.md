# Final Assignment
## Project: Efficiently Implementing Appropriate DataStructures

## Project Overview
The final assignment contains 3 questions. Your implementation should target the most efficient algorithms and data structures. You will be graded based on the efficiency of your implementation. You will not be awarded any points if you use simple nested loops to implement the below tasks.

### Question 1
In this question you will use the Data.users array that includes:
* a list of users. Formatted as : firstname,lastname,age,email,gender,city,state
* Create a User class that should parse all the parameters for each user.
* Insert each of the users in a list.
* Print out the TOP 10 oldest users.

### Question 2
In this question you will use the Data.users array that includes:
* a list of users. Formatted as : firstname,lastname,age,email,gender,city,state
* Create a User class that should parse all the parameters for each user.
* The goal is to count the number of users living each state.
* Print out the list of State, Count order in ascending order by count.
	 
### Question 3
In this question you will use the Data.users and Data.otherUsers array that includes:
* a list of users. Formatted as : firstname,lastname,age,email,gender,city,state
* Create a User class that should parse all the parameters for each user.
* The goal is to print out the users that are exist in both the Data.users and Data.otherUsers.
* Two users are equal if all their attributes are equal.
* Print out the list of users which exist in both Data.users and Data.otherUsers.
