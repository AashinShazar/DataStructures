# ListElevator Assignment
## Project: Working with more ArrayLists

## Project Overview
In this assignment, you will implement a simulation of an elevator that serves a building that has 5 floors. Each floor has a random number of passengers [0-5]. When the elevator starts, it will start from floor 1 and goes up. The elevator stops and opens its door to get passengers in only if there is at least one passenger on the floor or if itâ€™s checking out a passenger to the requested floor. Otherwise the elevator keeps moving. The elevator goes up to the fifth floor and then goes down to the first floor. By the end of the trip, the elevator should serve all the people who requested the service. Follows a breakdown of the simulation program.
